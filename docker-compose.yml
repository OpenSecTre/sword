# Compose is used to create the complete package locally to test and develop the application.
# Could also be used to do a full deployment of the application into a cloud platform if needed.

# NOTE the Dockerfile need to be in the root as they cannot go "up" from their build context and we need to navigate
#      into the server, client and few other directories for them so they need to be there.
